## <a name="Abst"></a>Abstract
The goal of this project is to propose developing an open source model for predicting house prices in the United States. 
House price prediction has been a topic that Data Scientists have been discussing. The datasets that are from Kaggle, 
UCI Machine learning Repository. The datasets conclude features of the house, geographical attributes, etc. The main goal of the project 
is to create an accessible and accurate predictive model that can offer valuable insights to the US housing markets. 
Various regression modeling techniques such as Random Forest classifier will be used to generate accurate and effective predictive models, 
The project also emphasizes the significance of the quality of the dataset. Ensuring the predictive model is not only accurate but also accountable and unbiased. 
Analysis will be done at three distinct geographic levels: state, county, and city. A major focus will be the geospatial aspect of U.S. housing markets. T
his method improves the model's predictions and gives insight on the regional variables affecting home values. 
The project's open-source model offers cooperation, enabling developers, companies, and real estate agents to all work together to contribute for the model's development. 
This open-source methodology seeks to empower a broad user base by offering a transparent and adaptable tool for housing price prediction. 
To ensure the project's relevance and influence in the ever-changing U.S. real estate sector, 
it will be essential to  enable the continuous integration for the live information, innovate modeling methodologies, and adhere to ethical principles.

## <a name="Intro"></a>Introduction

While researching the house prices in the United States because of the parent chores, My parent seem to struggle to decide whether it is a good time to buy or sell the house. How can house price prediction machine learning model can help people as an open source platform Informed Buying and Selling Decisions: Potential homebuyers can use house price predictions to make informed decisions about when and where to buy a property. Sellers can also benefit by pricing their homes competitively based on market trends. Financing: House price predictions can aid individuals in financial planning. Knowing the potential future value of a property can help homeowners plan for future expenses, investmenial Plats, and retirement. Real Estate Investment: Investors can use house price predictions to identify lucrative investment opportunities. Predicting the appreciation of property values helps investors make strategic decisions about buying, holding, or selling real estate assets. Risk Management: Financial institutions and mortgage lenders can use house price predictions to assess the risk associated with loans. This helps in making informed decisions about lending and managing potential financial risks

Machine Learning is a branch of AI and Computer Science. By feeding information like us humans to the algorithm by use of the data, it improves the accuracy. 
According to IBM “Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, and to uncover key insights in data mining projects. These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses….” 
There are various machine Learning techniques to build a model, but there are three major techniques that are commonly used. These techniques are based on statistical knowledge. 
First is Linear Regression, Linear regression is a technique that is used to study the relationship between independent variables and target variables.  next is Logistic Regression, this is also the regression and lastly it is Random Forest. 

Below picture is the large application of Machine Learning. As we can see, a large application of machine learning is affecting all the industries and affecting or maybe in bad words threatening people’s jobs. In many ways, they are more accurate than humans and do it cheaper than hiring a human. Machine learning's transformative impact on industries is undeniable, but it also raises concerns about its potential to automate certain tasks, potentially affecting employment. While ML systems offer increased accuracy and efficiency, there is an ongoing debate about the implications for the workforce and the need for reskilling in response to changing job requirements.

## Data Dashboard 
Data Dashboard seems to be the most effective way to have interactive communication with the general public who wants to buy or sell the house. Since, the main audience of the open source platform is for any users. This is the overall technical side of how the dashboard would work.  Get the API from the dataset from the government house price prediction. extract the data using the data pipeline and transform these into the visualization and load it into the cloud platform, During this process we will have to manage the Continuous integration part to make the dataset live. After loading these databases into the warehouse, It will go to the metabase dashboard. Continuous integration may be a term that is unfamiliar, it is a code that extracts the dataset every 5 minutes or time we set and keeps it live.
