## Food Rescue
Danielle Garon, Fall 2023


#### Abstract    

In this paper, I will propose an open-source project designed to help combat food waste on the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus. This platform would serve as an intermediary to connect restaurants and grocery stores that experience overstock and food waste to the local community who may be looking for a cheaper alternative for food. Through a user-friendly interface, the platform will facilitate seamless transactions, creating a vibrant ecosystem that promotes resource efficiency and community collaboration. In addition to this, I will be discussing the purpose of this project including the activities the community will be engaging in and the social infrastructure that will be employed. I will discuss what open-source principles would be useful for making this project successful and sustainable as well.


#### Introduction
Over the past summer, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark. There was a popular application there called “Too Good To Go” which is a service that connects customers to restaurants and stores that have surplus unsold food. This app has now been used in cities around the world and was just implemented in Chicago in 2021. Drawing inspiration from my observations and experiences working at two different restaurants/coffee shops around the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus, I couldn't help but recognize the significant amount of edible food discarded on a daily basis. Thinking about the Too Good To Go application and this food waste happening on campus, I feel that a project with a similar mission could be of great use in the Champaign-Urbana area. Additionally, I believe this project could greatly benefit college students on a budget and also the poorer populations in the area since they would be able to purchase food at cheaper rates. The prospect of providing affordable access to quality food could serve as a lifeline for those facing financial constraints. All parties involved would benefit since the restaurants and stores would be generating additional revenue and the people of the Champaign-Urbana area would have the opportunity to buy decent food at discounted rates. This virtuous cycle not only fosters economic sustainability but also strengthens community ties by addressing shared challenges. The potential impact of this project extends beyond the immediate stakeholders, reaching into the realms of environmental conservation, economic efficiency, and social equity. By repurposing surplus food that would otherwise end up in landfills, the project aligns with broader sustainability goals. Moreover, it provides an avenue for businesses to adopt more resource-efficient practices, contributing to the overall environmental well-being of the Champaign-Urbana community.


#### Background 

A common misconception is that the “best by” dates dictate the food in a grocery store’s usability when realistically, it is just a guideline. Because of these dates, lots of food items are often disposed of prematurely from grocery stores. This date is the manufacturer saying when the product is of good quality and the majority of the time the product is fine to be consumed past that date. It is legal to sell foods in grocery stores past these dates but most dispose of the food anyway. This practice not only contributes to the growing problem of food waste but also perpetuates the misunderstanding that these dates signify spoilage. In the realm of restaurants, a parallel issue arises where perfectly edible food ends up being thrown out at the end of the day, typically when it no longer serves a purpose in the restaurant's daily operations. These discarded food items are often not only consumable but also relatively fresh, having been prepared on the same day. The unfortunate reality is that, due to logistical reasons or lack of demand, these perfectly good meals end up in the garbage. A transformative solution to both of these instances of food waste lies in the potential of an application that could bridge the gap between surplus food and individuals seeking affordable and nutritious options. Such an application could revolutionize the way we perceive food expiration dates, encouraging consumers to make informed decisions about the actual freshness and usability of products rather than relying solely on arbitrary labels. 

#### Open-Source Solution     

In order to effectively address the pervasive issue of food waste and insecurity, my project aims to introduce a transformative platform named Food Rescue to the Champaign-Urbana area. With a community-oriented project like this, I believe that an open-source style management system is best for the ethos of transparency, collaboration, and community-based development. Embracing an open-source approach holds the promise of engaging a diverse and talented pool of developers from the Champaign-Urbana area and beyond. By making the source code readily accessible, this initiative invites local developers to actively participate in refining and expanding the Food Rescue platform. The collaborative nature of open source ensures that innovative features, timely bug fixes, and comprehensive enhancements emerge through the collective efforts of a community passionate about addressing food-related challenges. The strategic choice to implement an open-source model gains additional significance given the presence of the University of Illinois, renowned for its prestigious computer science program, in the vicinity. The prospect of involving enthusiastic and skilled individuals from this academic community adds a layer of expertise and commitment to the development process. Harnessing the potential of this talent pool could significantly accelerate the evolution of Food Rescue into a cutting-edge and impactful solution for the community. Beyond fostering community engagement and development, an open-source framework also facilitates the customization of the Food Rescue platform. Recognizing the diverse needs of businesses operating in the Champaign-Urbana area, the platform's adaptability becomes a key advantage. Businesses utilizing Food Rescue can tailor the platform to align with their specific operational requirements and overarching goals, ensuring a seamless fit that enhances their efficiency and effectiveness. It is crucial to emphasize that the proposal for creating the Food Rescue platform is a deliberate choice over simply implementing existing solutions like Too Good To Go. While the latter may provide a ready-made framework, the creation of Food Rescue allows for a more tailored and responsive solution that can be shaped by the local community. This approach not only addresses the unique challenges of the Champaign-Urbana area but also empowers the community to take ownership of the solution, fostering a sense of collective responsibility for sustainable change.


#### Collaboration       

Creating and sustaining Food Rescue will need a robust community of collaborators dedicated to the construction and ongoing maintenance of the application. The envisioned scope of the platform initially centers around serving the Champaign-Urbana area, leveraging its local connections and community engagement. However, there exists a potential for expansion over time, particularly to other college campuses. For the time being, the collaborator community will be limited to those in the Champaign-Urbana area because they have a connection and interest to the community which is the area of interest for the issue currently. This includes the recruitment of volunteers who share a passion for the cause and possess diverse skills to contribute to the application's growth. The collaborative efforts during this developmental period will not only shape the functionality and efficiency of the platform but also foster a sense of community ownership, ensuring its sustainability and relevance over time. As the application matures and gains traction in the Champaign-Urbana community, the potential for expansion to other college campuses becomes an exciting prospect. This planned scalability underscores the importance of cultivating a strong and committed collaborator community from the beginning, as they will play a pivotal role in adapting and tailoring the platform for diverse environments.

#### Access
Adopting a commitment to transparency and collaboration, the open-source nature of this project extends to the publication of all code on the widely-used platform, GitHub, ensuring public availability. Despite the public accessibility of the source code on GitHub, I intend to impose specific constraints to safeguard the source code's integrity. Adopting a commitment to transparency and collaboration, the open-source nature of this project extends to the publication of all code on the widely-used platform, GitHub, ensuring public availability. While fostering accessibility, it is imperative to strike a balance between openness and safeguarding the integrity of the source code. In light of this, specific constraints will be implemented to mitigate potential risks and unwarranted alterations. The primary ethos underlying this open-source initiative is to encourage active participation and engagement from interested parties. To this end, I will strongly advocate for the downloading of the source code, providing enthusiasts the opportunity to engage in remixing, modification, and experimentation with their individual copies. This inclusive approach aims to harness the collective creativity and expertise of the community, fostering a dynamic and collaborative development environment. However, to maintain a level of control over the project's core codebase and prevent inadvertent alterations that may compromise its integrity, I will permit only the downloadability of the code without the option for modification. This measure ensures that the project remains cohesive and aligns with its intended goals while still allowing for diverse applications and adaptations by the community. Furthermore, to fortify the code's protection, I will be adopting the MIT License. This license was chosen for its permissive nature, allowing individuals to modify and remix the code while concurrently offering a layer of defense against any malicious or undesired utilization of the code. This license empowers the community to actively participate in the evolution of the project while instilling a framework that upholds the ethical and legal considerations associated with the code's usage. This strategic combination of an open-source framework, selective constraints on modification, and the adoption of the MIT License ensures a collaborative and secure development environment. As the project evolves, these measures will contribute to a sustainable and transparent model, ensuring that the open-source philosophy remains a driving force behind its success.

####Phases
The strategic deployment of this application will be executed in phased stages, each geared towards ensuring the optimal quality and effectiveness of the final product. The first phase would be to develop a general outline of the application itself. This involves the development of a robust framework, the creation of an intuitive and user-friendly interface, and the establishment of the essential infrastructure. This foundational phase sets the stage for the subsequent steps, ensuring a solid base upon which the application can evolve and expand. Once the application exists and works we can then recruit restaurants and grocery stores that are interested in participating. The next phase will involve active recruitment efforts targeted at restaurants and grocery stores interested in participating. This stage is pivotal, as it transforms the conceptualized application into a tangible platform with real-world engagement. Collaborating with establishments willing to contribute surplus food is essential to populate the application with meaningful content, creating a valuable resource for the community. Once actual restaurants and grocery stores are participating in the application, word can be spread about the application to get people to use the application. Strategic marketing efforts, social media campaigns, and community outreach will be employed to effectively communicate the application's benefits to potential users. By showcasing the diverse offerings from local establishments, the goal is to incentivize individuals to incorporate the application into their daily routines, promoting both sustainability and affordability. Finally, changes and improvements will need to continually happen.  Regular feedback from users will be actively sought through a dedicated feedback forum embedded within the application. This iterative process allows for dynamic adjustments, addressing user concerns, incorporating valuable suggestions, and staying attuned to the evolving needs of the community. The feedback loop ensures that the application remains responsive, relevant, and continuously aligned with the expectations of both users and participating businesses. By adopting this phased deployment strategy, the application aims to strike a balance between careful development, community engagement, and ongoing improvement. 

####Features
The application would include many various features to make it most usable for customers. There will be a recommendations system to recommend places to the user and also recommendations based on what type of food the user is looking for. This will be done by leveraging user preferences and location data to suggest relevant places for consideration. All recommendations and listings will be listed in order of distance to the user. The proximity-based arrangement is aimed at prioritizing accessibility, enabling users to quickly identify and choose from nearby establishments, thereby reducing logistical barriers and promoting more sustainable choices. Through the application, users will be able to rate different places and the quality of the food they receive from these places. This feature not only serves as a valuable resource for other users making informed decisions but also provides constructive feedback to participating restaurants and grocery stores, fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Each establishment will feature a comprehensive profile within the application, offering users a holistic understanding of their offerings. This includes an overall description of the place, creating a narrative that goes beyond mere listings. Furthermore, to provide real-time information on availability, the concept of "bags" will be introduced. This involves the categorization of leftover food into individual bags, ready for distribution at the end of the day or at specified times. The number of bags available at each location will be prominently displayed, ensuring transparency and accuracy in what is offered for sale. The introduction of the "bags" concept serves a dual purpose: it not only aligns with the operational practices of participating establishments but also plays a crucial role in managing inventory and preventing overselling. By providing users with clear information on the quantity of bags at each location, the application ensures that only the surplus food available is offered for sale, eliminating the risk of discrepancies and enhancing the reliability of the platform.

####Sustainability
The Food Rescue platform will undoubtedly need continual work to remain updated and useful for prospective users. Recognizing the dynamic nature of the food industry and the evolving needs of users, a commitment to continuous improvement and updates becomes imperative. There will need to be a way to confirm the legitimacy of the restaurants and grocery stores that want to participate. An endorsed system is essential to validate the authenticity and accuracy of postings. The significance of this validation system is paramount, as it not only instills confidence in users but also guarantees that the surplus food offerings listed are genuine and align with the platform's core mission. As the platform gains popularity, assigning this task to a single person becomes impractical, creating a potential point of failure. I plan to implement an agile workflow, entrusting the responsibility to dedicated project members. In this agile framework, each project member will be assigned a specific role in the validation process, streamlining the workflow and ensuring a swift and efficient validation turnaround. Regular feedback loops, continuous testing, and iterative updates will be ingrained in the development process. This approach not only ensures the platform's adaptability to emerging challenges but also allows for the seamless integration of new features and improvements based on user feedback.
