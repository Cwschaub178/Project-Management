## TITLE
A Healthy Shopping Application


### Abstract  

In this paper I will be outlining a timeline and details for developing an open source application for planning, reviewing, and ordering groceries from local businesses. This application will have a particular focus on healthy eating, community, and supporting lesser known brands. I will be discussing ideas from class in order to develop a timeline and plan for the platform, a health-focused and dedicated community, and a sustainable open source and funding model for further growth and transparency with development. 

### Introduction/Background

With much of the world currently in an extremely uneasy situation both economically and politically, many people have started to see prices rising, particularly when it comes to their groceries and everyday necessities due to rising inflation and poor supply chain management. This project is intended to be a hypothetical application which would allow users to check stores near them, compare prices, create shopping lists, discuss diets, rate and review products/stores, get items delivered, and overall encourage and help users to create the healthiest and cheapest shopping experience possible. This overarching goal of creating this community based application is aimed at creating an online town forum/market dedicated to allowing users the freedom and flexibility to plan and discuss their groceries and diets without the tireless research and store searching. This application/site would be heavily focused on healthy products, and trying to create diets and shopping lists that don’t include big brand name (often heavily processed) products with unhealthy ingredients. While it would mainly be a shopping app to plan things out beforehand, there will also be a heavy emphasis on creating a community centered around finding lesser known, healthier chains and products, and cheaper alternatives. 
	I care about this project because I myself struggle with finding and planning out groceries and what I am going to need when I get to the store. I’m someone who doesn't like to waste time, and so I get quite annoyed having to walk around the store looking for things and wandering through aisles. I also am someone who grew up with a rather unhealthy habit of enjoying snacks and sweets, and have been struggling to get away from all of the processed chemicals in most of today’s products as I’ve gotten older. And so, even prior to enrolling in this course, I had been thinking up an idea for some kind of grocery based app, and thought this class would be an interesting way to expand on it and figure out if it would be feasible. Another important factor is that fewer and fewer Americans are eating healthy, and many see price and lack of preparation as large barriers to beginning. 
	As I mentioned in the introduction, an important aspect of this project to me is the prospect of creating a community centered around helping each other plan and budget for cheap and healthy groceries and produce. Preferably, the community would also have a focus on supporting smaller businesses and local produce, and a general ‘democratic’ and free market ideology driving it. I will be discussing ways to create a sustainable open source platform with a community dedicated to seeing the platform develop through consistent updates and transparency. 
	This project will also utilize a subscription based platform model in order to bring in revenue and keep up with server expenses and costs associated with use of alternate APIs and data. The pricing model would be subject to change, for scaling purposes, although there would also be two versions of the application. A free version with limited use of services, and the subscription version with full functionality and access. I also hope to lay out a plan for creating the user based product review market through allowing users to market and sell their own products.


### Why Open Source?     

This project would be utilizing the open source model in order to maximize user satisfaction through consistent updates, develop a collaborative community, and to create a level of trust and security within that community. Open Source is becoming an increasingly popular choice for developers and users alike, as it ensures that the correct people’s interests are at the forefront of the application and business model, the users themselves. 
The use of an open-source platform offers a myriad of benefits, with one of the key advantages lying in the transparency and accessibility of its codebase. Open source code is visible to all, fostering collaboration and trust, and enabling a diverse community of developers to contribute, identify vulnerabilities, and suggest improvements. This not only results in a more robust and secure platform but also facilitates continuous innovation and growth. Open source also has many benefits with regards to cost-effectiveness. Additionally, the collaborative nature of open source ensures that updates and patches are rolled out swiftly, enhancing the overall sustainability of the platform. 
The collective effort of the community creates a self-sustaining ecosystem where the application can adapt and evolve, meeting the dynamic needs of users and maintaining relevance in the ever-changing landscape of technology and user expectations. This community will be focussed entirely on providing better quality spaces for discussing healthy eating, as well as providing users with easier access to healthy eating through the platform’s services. Due to the nature of health-conscious people, this community will foster dedication among developers and users wishing to provide their ideas, programming skills, and knowledge to the community effort. 


### Target Market & Community Building

The target market and audience for this open-source project are individuals and communities who prioritize healthy eating, sustainable living, and supporting local businesses and produce. Health-conscious consumers seeking a platform that seamlessly integrates nutritional guidance, community engagement, and access to a wide array of locally sourced, wholesome products form a significant portion of the target audience. This demographic is often composed of individuals with a keen interest in adopting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, valuing the transparency and authenticity that comes with knowing the origins of their food, which will allow this project to hopefully maintain a steady user base. There will also be an appeal to parents and anyone looking to save time and money on groceries and dealing with finding healthy options.
Furthermore, the project appeals to those who wish to champion the cause of local and small businesses. Sellers, particularly local producers of organic, artisanal, or niche food products, are a crucial segment of the target market. The platform serves as a market for these businesses to connect with a broader audience, showcasing their products in an environment that values community support, transparency, and fosters a sense of shared well-being. By facilitating direct engagement between consumers and local sellers, the project aims to create a virtuous cycle of community empowerment and economic sustainability, reinforcing the idea that healthy living extends beyond personal choices to encompass the vitality of local economies and businesses, and involves helping the community become healthier. 
In terms of supporting the community and its growth, there would be many promotions with local businesses and within the community and on the platform to encourage participation and create more dedicated supporters. Going along with the subscription idea, there could be many bonus promotions and special deals for the premium members. Overall, the goal is to combine the open source and community oriented aspects of the project to create a dedicated and loyal group of health minded individuals who are eager to spread healthy lifestyles. 


### Strategies for Sustainability    

A comprehensive strategy for the sustainability of the health platform involves an approach that addresses common economic, social, and technological challenges associated with similar endeavors. As mentioned in the open source section and community sections, building a dedicated community is vital to sustainability. The platform should actively encourage user participation, feedback, and contribution to create a sense of ownership and shared responsibility. Of course, being an open source project helps tremendously in this aspect, as it allows for diverse contributions, community problem-solving, dedicated developers and community, and strong foundations for continuous updates. This community-driven model not only promotes user loyalty but also ensures a continuous influx of ideas, support, and even potential contributors.
In terms of financial sustainability, implementing a freemium or subscription-based model can be considered. While the core features promoting healthy eating, community interaction, and local business support remain freely accessible, a subscription model could offer premium services, advanced features, or personalized content and discounts, and access to special products. Revenue generated from subscriptions can be reinvested into platform maintenance, feature development, and for licenses to databases and other software tools, such as the Yuka app’s product database. 
Collaboration with local businesses and producers is key to the economic sustainability of this project, along with the premium subscription model. Building strong partnerships with small and sustainable food producers can create a mutually beneficial ecosystem. Offering specialized promotional and advertising packages for these businesses within the platform can provide a revenue stream while amplifying the platform's commitment to supporting local economies. The map service for the application would ideally be done the same way services like Yelp do, where businesses can input their own data, along with our own databases. The platform would allow for producers and businesses to market their brands and products as well. 
Lastly, continuous innovation and adaptation to evolving health trends and technological advancements will be vital for the platform's long-term success. Regular updates, scalability, and embracing emerging technologies ensure that the platform remains relevant and has a stable user base. Another vital aspect to this will be the fostering of quality developer communication, with discord/slack and Github, discussion forums, and bots to automate processes. Dedicated forums and team pages will allow for more developers to join in and give input, easier access to current issues to be addressed, and clear and organized communication between teams. 

### Funding & Timeline

This project is quite ambitious, so it would be split up into large segments across a large timeline, with basic features available to begin with during earlier flights. Further expansion would include development of premium subscription services (route planning, possible rideshare implementation, etc.) and rolling out into local areas.
