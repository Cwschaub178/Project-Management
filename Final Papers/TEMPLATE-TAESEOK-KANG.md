## <a name="Abst"></a>Abstract
The goal of this project is to propose developing an open source model for predicting house prices in the United States. 
House price prediction has been a topic that Data Scientists have been discussing. The datasets that are from Kaggle, 
UCI Machine learning Repository. The datasets conclude features of the house, geographical attributes, etc. The main goal of the project 
is to create an accessible and accurate predictive model that can offer valuable insights to the US housing markets. 
Various regression modeling techniques such as Random Forest classifier will be used to generate accurate and effective predictive models, 
The project also emphasizes the significance of the quality of the dataset. Ensuring the predictive model is not only accurate but also accountable and unbiased. 
Analysis will be done at three distinct geographic levels: state, county, and city. A major focus will be the geospatial aspect of U.S. housing markets. T
his method improves the model's predictions and gives insight on the regional variables affecting home values. 
The project's open-source model offers cooperation, enabling developers, companies, and real estate agents to all work together to contribute for the model's development. 
This open-source methodology seeks to empower a broad user base by offering a transparent and adaptable tool for housing price prediction. 
To ensure the project's relevance and influence in the ever-changing U.S. real estate sector, 
it will be essential to  enable the continuous integration for the live information, innovate modeling methodologies, and adhere to ethical principles.
