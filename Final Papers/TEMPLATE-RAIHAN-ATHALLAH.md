## Restaurant Management Platform Project
Raihan Athallah, Fall 2023

### Abstract
Throughout this paper, I will introduce you to my project about creating a restaurant management platform. I will discuss this project's target audiences alongside the goals I intend to make. Furthermore, I will explain the various principles, such as roadmaps, workflows, and community building, and how, by utilizing them, I can make this project run and become sustainable.

### Introduction

#### Background
Currently, in Indonesia, my parents are preparing to open a restaurant, and after hearing their plans, I wanted to help and participate in a way I knew possible. I decided to create/design a restaurant management platform as an application. During this semester, I have also taken a class that teaches human-computer interaction, and from that course, I learned that by creating a proper UI/UX for an application design could immensely impact the customer's experience when going to a restaurant.

One of the ways I imagined helping my parents create a restaurant management platform was by developing an application that contained everything the customers would want when they went to a restaurant, like a menu, call, reservation, and payment. Nowadays, in Indonesia, especially in Jakarta, many restaurants have started using a digitized menu, compared to that of the traditional paper menu, and all of that can be accessed through our personal mobile devices instead of a separate tablet. According to an article from Medium, opting to create a digitized version gives many advantages to both the restaurant's owners and its customers. Some of the benefits mentioned include saving the restaurant owners' cost, being convenient for the customers, and being less impactful towards the environment compared to using paper based. While having a digitized menu is convenient, why not continue and develop it further? I believe there are still a lot of features and designs that could be implemented and created to improve customer service and satisfaction.

#### Purpose
While my primary purpose in doing this project surrounds my parent's desire to open a restaurant in Indonesia, I also wanted to see if there was a way to improve a restaurant's service. Thus, the idea of creating a restaurant management platform surfaced. As I previously mentioned, I took a class this semester that discussed human-computer interaction, and one of the ideas that stood out while learning was how to prioritize the users and how we could cater to our target audience. That's something that has yet to be much improved in restaurant businesses. For instance, nowadays, restaurants have begun to implement the use of a digital menu and tablets on tables (Beckett). However, that could still be improved, such as creating a complete application instead of individual and divided apps that can be launched directly from our smartphone and be used to look at the menu, call the servers, and pay for our meal.

#### Target Audience and Goals
This project's target audience would be the restaurant's customers. Our model end user for the application would be a minimum of at least 12 years old, with them being able to have a basic understanding of English or the native language and, in this case, Bahasa Indonesia. Lastly, they must understand currency since they need to read the price and pay for their food. Since I plan to create an application that can cater to all the customer's needs when they are dining, I would have to look into the devices they are using, such as phones, tablets, laptops, etc. With this being in the early stages of launch, the focus for this project will be on the development and creation of the application for mobile devices since almost everyone in the world nowadays carries it with them at all times. 

This project aims to create a user-friendly restaurant menu application that simplifies meal selection and enhances the customer's dining experience. For me to achieve this goal, I would need to research software tools that are capable of producing a user-friendly interface that is easy to customize, use, and develop.

### Project Scope
In order for the development of the restaurant management platform to run successfully, the project scope for this will be divided into two phases. The restaurant's application will be launched by the end of the first phase. Within the first phase, we will focus on developing features that are essential to make the restaurant application usable and stand out for the customers. In the second phase of the project scope, we will integrate new features within the application. The features within the second phase are less crucial than in the first phase but are nice to have and could even improve the customer's interaction with the application.

#### Phase 1

#### User Features:
- **Language Page**

  The first page that the customers would be greeted upon entering the application will be a language page. The reason for this is that since I am planning to launch this application in Indonesia, looking at our customer market, they will mainly be those who speak the native language, which is Bahasa Indonesia. However, I need to take into account that there might be those who prefer to speak English or foreigners who dine in restaurants. Because of that, I will also implement the choice for the application to be used in English.

- **Instruction Page**

  The next page would be an instruction page. This is useful and beneficial for first-time users, as it could help and guide customers on how to use the application and what tabs or pages to go through in order for them to make their purchase. Furthermore, by having an instruction page, the customers could always go back and look through any issues they might have encountered throughout their time using the application. Since people might have problems if only words were involved, I would include pictures as visual guides to help them navigate the application.

- **Main Screen**

  Once the customers have gone through the instruction screen, they enter the main screen. I will implement three tabs at the bottom within the main screen that will lead to different pages. The three pages are the Menu Page, Call Page, and Order Page.

- **Menu Page**

  I plan to make the menu page the home page since users would mainly use the app to primarily look at all the food and beverages that the restaurant has to offer. The menu page will have tabs that show the selection of appetizers, main courses, desserts, and beverages. Once the customers see something on the menu that they would like to order, they could go and press on the picture to get a more in-depth description of the food. It will include a brief description of the food, what it may contain, food options, and the number of purchases they would like to add to the cart. The menu page will also include a search bar on the top, allowing customers to search for any food or drinks and order them quickly.

- **Call Page**

  Within the call page, the customers will see a button that they can press if they want to call the servers. Once they press the button, a server will head to their table shortly after. If they mistakenly press the button, I will also implement a cancel button, which undos the customer's action. The reason for the implementation of the call page is because, through my experience, there were times when we, as customers, couldn't get the attention of our servers, or it was too hectic that they couldn't see us trying to call them. With the implementation of the button, the customer could have peace of mind that someone will come to their table without having to worry.

- **Order Page**

  The Order Page will show the customer's order that they have made when they add their food and beverages within the menu page. The Order Page will show the amount of delicacies the customers have ordered and their total bill. If they have finished eating, they can scroll to the bottom of the page and click pay, where they will be shown a QR code they can bring to the cashier. According to an article from The Economic Times, the use of QR codes for payment allows for a more secure and quicker transaction while also increasing the customer's experience throughout the process. Using QR codes can also help the cashier make a smoother and faster transaction, saving time and preventing a queue from forming. Lastly, nowadays in Indonesia, many people use digital wallets with QR scanners to pay, and to cater to how people do their transactions now, integrating the use of QR codes for payment will be adequate.

- **Feedback Tab**

  Lastly, a Feedback Tab, where once the customers have completed their transaction, a page will pop out asking them for feedback regarding their restaurant experience and experience with the application. Customers could write about the things the application could improve upon, which we will take into account for the continuation of the application in the future.

#### Phase 2

#### Additional User Features:

- **Promo Page**

  A promo page could help attract customers to discounts or promotions within the restaurant. Customers will be alerted through notifications about available promos that are happening, and they could apply them when they dine within the restaurant.

- **Take-Out Option**

  Considering that not everyone has time to dine in the restaurant, implementing a take-out option would be helpful for customers. The features within the application, when this option is pressed instead of the dining option, would be very similar. The most significant difference would be that there won't be any Call Page, but rather, that would be replaced with a help button, where they can't directly text/call the restaurant if any issues arise. The customers would also be alerted about the progress of their orders and if they are ready for them to be picked up yet; this way, the customers wouldn't have to wait for a long time, and when they arrived, they could get their food and leave.

- **Reservation Option**

  Another feature to be implemented is a reservation option, where customers can book a table in advance. Through this option, customers could make a booking for a large party, or if they want a spot before they arrive.

All the features from phase one and two will be rigorously tested within their development to ensure that there are no bugs or errors when launched to the public.


#### Organization Structure

| <b>Figure 2.</b> Workflow Structure|

To identify the organization structure, we will create a workflow that shows the responsibilities of each individual. The structure will have a project manager be the one who supervises the entire development process of the project. The project manager is responsible for guiding the whole team to finish the project on time, leading the team meetings, and dividing and providing the tasks given to the team. The designer and developer team are under the project manager. The design team is responsible for designing the user interface and experience of the application. The developer team is divided into the back-end and front-end developers. The back-end developers are responsible for managing and organizing the application database, while the front-end developers are responsible for building the visual and interactive elements of the application that users interact with directly.

| <b>Figure 3.</b> Roadmap of the Project|

For the project to run smoothly, we will develop a roadmap to organize all the tasks that must be completed before the app's official launch. Since the restaurant aims to open in the summer of 2024, this project must be completed in six months. In the first month, we will focus on organizing the team and developing ideas for the application creation. In the second month, the design team will start creating a wireframe design for the UI/UX of the application with clickable functionality so the development team can understand. In the third month, the developer team will start creating the application. In the fourth month, the developer team will continue to finish the app and conduct internal testing to find bugs within the application. In the fifth month, the project manager will hold a beta release for a limited number of people in order to get feedback from the real world and continue to refine the app based on the suggestions given by those who participated in the beta release. Finally, in the sixth month, we will officially launch the app to the public, monitor the app, and continue to provide support.
  
### Strategies

#### Coding Management
Since I aim for the application to be used on all smartphone platforms, we will use multiple programming languages for each platform. We will use Swift as the coding language for the front-end development of the application on the IOS platform, while for the Android platform, we will use either Kotlin or Java. Regarding the Back-end development of the app that manages the application's database and server, we will use Python and SQL. 

I also aim to use GitHub to collect and store the code with the team. With GitHub being free to use and accessible on almost every device, it is the best way to share code with the team. Furthermore, on GitHub, we could easily manage and use the code for version control so we know our history each time we update the code.

#### Communication
In order to avoid any miscommunication between team members during the whole project, the team will use Discord since it's free and compatible with many devices as a way to communicate with each other. Through Discord, we can conduct real-time communication between each other through the use of voice and video calls alongside screen sharing when we want to discuss an issue we are facing. Since we can create channels in Discord, building our community and dividing each person with their assigned task is easy.

### Community

#### Newsletter
To engage with the community, one of the ways we can reach out to our customers is by letting them sign up for a newsletter within the app, where they will be part of our mailing list and receive any information regarding an event that could happen. Since the restaurant will hold music events, the customers could place their email into the application and receive dates, info, and event promo that could be happening if they came to the restaurant.

#### Notifications
If the customers don't want to sign up for an email newsletter, they could turn on notification settings on their phone. We will send them information on events, their reservations, discounts or promos, and their pick-up orders through the notifications.

#### Food Ratings
When they have finished dining in, they can review their meals and give them a star rating. Through this, customers after them can know the food of the day and recommendations. They would build a community, then let us know which foods on the menu the restaurant should focus on and which ones to replace or have less inventory off.

### Project Sustainability
In order to ensure the project's future and sustainability, the project manager, alongside the team, will have to monitor the application continuously. While monitoring, they must be aware of any bugs or errors that could arise, and if there are any, they must be prepared to launch updates to keep the application safe and secure for the customers to use.

Since the application has a feedback tab at the end of their dining experience, the project manager must assess those suggestions and implement those that could be beneficial for the application and help improve the user's experience the next time they dine at the restaurant.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, this restaurant management platform serves to give its users the finest dining experience through the use of an application from their mobile device. All the features mentioned in the first and second phases are developed to hold the user as the center of attention, with the application including all the necessities needed for them to enjoy their time. Furthermore, applying all the mentioned strategies in developing the application could enhance the customer's dining experience while also being a sustainable platform for the restaurant in the long term. Finally, with active community engagement and feedback, the application could continue to improve and help users.
