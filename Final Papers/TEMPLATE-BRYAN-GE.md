Bryan Ge, Fall 2023

### Introduction
In this paper, I will be describing an idea for an open-source finance accountability app where people and their friends can share financial activity to keep each other accountable for their budgeting goals. Along with that, I will also be discussing the purpose and impact of this app and a general overview of managing this project.

The purpose of the application is to solve the problem of staying financially accountable for your goals. Today, many apps connect with your bank accounts and transaction history to help you visualize your spending and savings through graphs and numbers. However, these applications are all narrowly designed for you to keep track of your finances on your own. By expanding the view of your spending to a group of close friends or family, you may be able to find yourself held more accountable and in a fun and supportive environment.

Regarding the development of the application, here are important features and factors to take into account for the best possible user experience. An imperative consideration for any successful mobile app is an interface that marries functionality with simplicity. A visually appealing and intuitive design ensures that users can effortlessly input and access their financial data, creating an engaging and accessible user experience. The heart of the app lies in its ability to seamlessly track expenses. Users can either manually input expenditures or opt for automated tracking by linking the app to their bank accounts through a service such as Plaid. Categorizing expenses provides users with a granular understanding of their spending patterns, empowering them to make informed financial decisions. To encourage collaborative financial planning, the app could allow users to create shared budgets with friends. Implementing spending limits across various categories ensures users adhere to predefined financial boundaries, promoting conscientious spending habits within the group. Keeping users aware of their financial activities in real time is essential. Push notifications can be utilized to alert users when they approach or exceed spending limits, instigating a proactive approach to financial management. Incorporating social features within the app fosters a sense of community among users. Connecting with friends and sharing financial insights through social media-like capabilities creates a collaborative environment centered around responsible financial habits. Streamlining the process of tracking shared expenses for group activities or events is pivotal. The app can facilitate the division of expenses among friends, maintaining a transparent record of who owes what, and simplifying the settlement of financial matters within the group. Motivating users and their friends to stick to financial goals can be achieved through challenges or goal-setting systems. Reminders and notifications serve as friendly nudges, encouraging users to stay on track and discouraging detrimental overspending. Comprehensive reports and analytics offer users valuable insights into their financial behaviors. Visual representations such as graphs or charts provide a quick and easy overview, equipping users with the information needed to make sound financial decisions. Ensuring the security of sensitive financial data is paramount. Robust security measures and customizable privacy settings empower users to control the extent of financial information shared with friends, fostering a secure and trusted platform.
